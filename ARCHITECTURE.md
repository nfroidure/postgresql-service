## PostgreSQL service

This service is a simple wrapper around the `pg` node module.

API Doc: https://node-postgres.com/features/pooling

[See in context](./src/pg.ts#L66-L71)



### Tagged template queries

The `pg` module uses simple `$n` placeholder for queries values
 that are provided in an array.

This tagged template function adds a level of abstraction
 transforming the following expression:
 `sql\`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=${userId}\`` with `userId=1` }
 into `{ text: 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=$1', values: [1] }`
 under the hood.

[See in context](./src/sql.ts#L82-L92)



### Errors casting

This service also convert `pg` errors into `yerror` ones which taste
 better imo.

[See in context](./src/pg.ts#L243-L247)



#### Mocking pg

The pg mock uses the [`jest`](https://jestjs.io) under the hood.
 You will have to use Jest to use it.

Its purpose it to ensure queries are well formed while mocking
 in the tests and that the values placeholder really have a value
 associated to it in the values hash.

[See in context](./src/pg.mock.ts#L7-L15)



### Timezones

Ensure not messing with time zones with practical defaults.
See https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/issues/389

// TODO: Ensure arrays are well parsed too with `postgres-array` for
// 1115 - timestamp without time zone[]
// 1182 - date[]

[See in context](./src/pg.ts#L15-L23)
